```Chris

"I'm mad because I'm high and I feel good and I really wanna touch your head and suck your dick and you won't let me"

```

^^ pretty succinctly illustrates up my primary reservation about letting Chris stay here. Also, 

```Chris

"Can I have a little more brown? What you gave me made me really high and felt really good and now that you're doing some it's making me want to do some. I really just want to do it because I see that you're about to. Can I have some? Want to do them together?" *Eyes light up eagerly*

```

This has got to be the worst of my drug-related pet peeves (not complaining about Chris specifically; lots of people do what I'm about to describe and I've caught myself doing it on occasion): somebody else wanting to do _____ for no other reason than that I'm doing it, especially if their behavior is making me feel like they don't actually care about _____ and just want to build rapport (like people asking for a cigar, lighting it, taking 1 puff, then handing it back tryna be like "that was great, I'm done, thanks!" like it's cool they just wasted $10 or $20 or $50, pretty much guarantees I will never willingly speak to that person again. Next time just pull a $50 bill out of your wallet and light it on fire for approximately the same experience. Oh, you don't just walk around with 50s to burn? You know how much these cost, right? Why you tryna do something expensive you don't even care about with my money?*). Now I know that using H is something that you literally cannot be objectively neutral about, and I know Chris has done plenty of opioids and knows what he likes, but damn does it make me feel like I'm being taxed by my tenant for staying in my own house. I didn't think it was remarkable or even weird until the "want to do them together" question, which felt very much like he was asking if we could rub our dicks together or... well, I can't even think of anything else off the top of my head that, for me personally, invokes a kind of uniquely undesirable and icky discomfort. __No__, I don't mean undesirable like "I'm in the closet", I mean like "send shivers down my spine and involuntarily recoil" kind of undesirable, which in my mind cements the firmly-established idea that I am, in fact, cishet scum.

* a reference specifically to an event that occurred during the CSR camping trip with Ashley Philpo circa 2012 or 2013. Obviously the intent wasn't malicious, but the sheer ignorance and utter lack of experience with tobacco / nicotine she demonstrated makes me baffled as to why she would even ask in the first place. Today, $50 is pocket change, but in 2012 I made about a quadrillion times less money than I do now - little enough that I recall being resentful about this incident for some time and evidently, some of that has persisted to the present day against all odds and rationality.

Real quick (~2min), I need to keep working on my project but I don't want to skip over the first point. Chris is sort of like the opposite of Rhiannon, and I mean that as a compliment, or at least with a highly positive sentiment. He is anything but a couch potato and always engaged in _something_ that isn't banal television. At this specific moment, it is slightly inconvenient in that _I need to finish this fucking project today, ASAP_, which raises one of the few concerns I have.

Like most people who qualify as addicts, Chris insists that he has a perpetual/omnipresent, superhuman tolerance, even after a period of abstinence, and like most of those people, he is wrong. I know this because I've gotten high with him plenty of times and seen him get lost in the sauce or otherwise incapacitated plenty of times, usually when he wasn't expecting it in the least. What this means is that about 80% of the time, he overshoots his limits slightly and gets stuck, and in about 80% of _those_ instances (that I've been around for), the activity he gets stuck on is arguing with me,  
    1. _persisting_ in the delusion that he is most certainly not stuck, which he will prove by winning this argument however long it takes (ironically a _classic_ sign of speed overintoxication)
    2. repeatedly getting side-twacked with telling stories and anecdotes in a way that drags out the conversation by nesting the original goal in such progressively deeper scopes that the point becomes mangled and incomprehensible and the discussion is ensured to continue in perpetuity until I force a hard-stop, at which point he (inadvertently, I assume)
    3. gets butthurt that I don't care to indulge in what I know will become a black hole of attention whoring. "_Sorry bro, I just love talking to you so much, you have a _____ (complimentary adjective) mind that I'm just so attracted to" \*attempts to engage physically\*_, which I shut down immediately before he
    4. starts trying to convince me I should let him give me a blowjob as though I have to win the argument or he'll be entitled to it; but he _definitely_ isn't gay though or in love with me even though this exact sequence of dialogue, or some similar variant thereof, repeats itself _every time I try to shift my attention elsewhere_ while the conditions described above are satisfied, __and that is where I feel like this becomes problematic__.

Later, I need to articulate precisely what is problematic about these repetitive discussions because it isn't obvious to him, and it is my responsibility to set boundaries accordingly. I didn't want him to come until Monday specifically because I anticipated this, and since he seems incapable of either using smaller amounts of speed (so as not to become fixated on chatting/flirting with me) or shutting the fuck up and coexisting while each doing our own thing (I will explain what I am doing, why it is more important than whatever story he wants to tell me, and under what conditions I will be able to entertain him; he will say he understands, pipe down for up to 10 seconds, and then be so full-to-bursting with new content that he *has* to express some of it and it needs to be right now, by talking at me), it seemed easiest to simply block out/disengage from hanging out for long periods of time until I have the free time and emotional energy to further deconstruct the problem and implement a solution, but alas, life doesn't always allow us to take those lines. I sympathize because I know that I used to do this quite a lot, and still have the potential to do so when __I__ overindulge.

I am not responsible for him feeling butt-hurt that I don't like it when he tries to touch me in a way that gives him obvious sexual pleasure.

__SHORT-TERM SOLUTION__: invent a new word or phrase that unambiguously means "I do not wish to proceed with the current line of discussion at this time and insist that we put it on hold for later - I am not mad, or upset, or feeling like we are in conflict in any way, nor am I suggesting that you are any of these things, or that you need to defend yourself, I just have __shit to do__ that supersedes whatever it is you want to share with me and I cannot indulge until such time as I'm spread less thin over my responsibilities. There is no need to feel butthurt that I am putting my needs before you, and I am not suggesting you feel that way; I am simply asserting a complete inability to engage on the level you want until these condition(s) are met: [...Conditions].

^^ if this is not effective then I feel justified in kind of being a dick about it and just putting my headphones on. The fuck is he gonna do? I can only be fazed so much by crocodile tears and puppy-dog eyes.

The silver lining is that I have a newfound empathic appreciation and respect for women, because this must be what they feel like literally all the time - nobody says that shit to me who isn't Revered/Exalted or higher with me already, because Viking Warrior Privilege.
